# Predicting Autoimmune Disorders Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project explores the use of machine learning models to predict autoimmune disorders from structured healthcare data. The goal is to evaluate which algorithms best capture non-linear relationships common in medical data in order to help speed up the diagnosis process for these complex diseases. 

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Neural Networks (PyTorch)

## Methods
- Data preprocessing and one-hot encoding
- Hyperparameter tuning using grid search and randomized search
- 5-fold cross-validation for model evaluation
- Comparison of linear vs non-linear models

## Results
Random Forest and Neural Network models achieved approximately 97–98% validation and test accuracy, significantly outperforming logistic regression.

## Tools & Technologies
Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, pandas, scikit-learn

## Ethical Considerations
This project is intended for educational and decision-support exploration only and does not replace professional medical diagnosis.
